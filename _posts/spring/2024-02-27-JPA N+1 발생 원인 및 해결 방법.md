JPA를 사용한다면 한번쯤은 마주쳤던, 또는 들어 봤던 문제입니다.  
바로 N+1 문제인데요. 원인과 해결방법을 알아보겠습니다.

## N + 1 문제란?
* * *

JPA에서 연관 관계가 설정된 엔티티 사이에서 한 엔티티를 조회하였을 때 `조회된 엔티티의 개수(N개)`만큼  
연관된 엔티티를 조회하기 위해`추가적인 쿼리가 발생하는 (+1)` 문제를 의미합니다.

<br><br>

## 지연로딩 & 즉시로딩

JPA에서 연관 관계를 설정할 때 먼저 알아야하는 필수적인 개념이 있습니다.  
그것은 바로 `Fetch Type` 입니다.

### FetchType 이란?
* JPA가 하나의 Entity를 조회할 때, 연관관계에 있는 객체들을 어떻게 가져올 것인지에 대한 설정값
* default값 -> `xxToOne = EAGER`, `xxToMany = LAZY`


### 즉시로딩 (Eager)
* 데이터를 조회할 때, 연관된 모든 객체의 데이터까지 한번에 불러오는 것

### 지연로딩 (Lazy)
* 데이터를 조회할 때는 프록시를 통해 가짜 객체를 넣어놓고 실제 조회 시점에 데이터를 불러오는 것



<br> <br>

## 발생하는 상황

N+1 문제를 재현하기 위해 아래와 같이 연관관계를 걸어주었습니다.
```java
@Entity
public class Board {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "board_id")
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    private String content;

    private String writer;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "board", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<Reply> replieList = new ArrayList<>();

}


@Entity
public class Reply {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  @Column(name = "reply_id")
  private Long id;

  private String content;

  @JoinColumn(name = "board_id")
  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  private Board board;

}

```

아래는 N + 1 문제 발생을 위한 테스트 코드입니다.

```java
    @DisplayName("N+1 테스트")
    @Test
    void test() {
        saveData();
        em.flush();
        em.clear();

        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 데이터 조회 ----------");
        List<Board> boardList = boardRepository.findAll();
        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 데이터 조회 완료 (1번의 쿼리) ---------- \n");


        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 제목, 내용, 작성자 조회 ----------");
        boardList.forEach(System.out::println);
        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 제목, 내용, 작성자 조회 완료 ----------\n");

        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 내부 REPLY 내용 조회 ----------");
        boardList.forEach(board -> {
            board.getReplieList().forEach(System.out::println);
        });
        System.out.println("---------- BOARD 내부 REPLY 내용 조회 완료 (N+1 문제 발생) ----------");


    }

    private void saveData() {
        IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10).forEach(i -> {

            Board board = Board.builder()
                    .title(i + " board-title")
                    .content(i + " board-content")
                    .writer(i + " board-writer")
                    .build();

            IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 3).forEach(j -> {
                board.writerReply(j + " reply-content");
            });

            boardRepository.save(board);
        });
    }
```
실행 결과는 아래와 같습니다.

---------- BOARD 내부 REPLY 내용 조회 완료 (N+1 문제 발생) ----------
```

로그를 확인하면 Board 개수인 10개만큼의 추가적인 쿼리가 발생한걸 확인할 수 있습니다.  
이 문제를 `N + 1`이라고 부릅니다.  

그럼 이 문제는 `지연로딩` 에서만 발생할까요?  
아닙니다. `즉시로딩` 으로 변경하여  테스트 해보겠습니다.

N+1 쿼리가 나가는 시점만 달라졌을뿐 N+1문제가 발생하는걸 확인할 수 있습니다.

## 해결 방법

### fetch join 사용

* 조회의 주체가 되는 Entity 이외에 Fetch Join이 걸린 연관 Entity도 함께 SELECT 하여 모두 영속화
* Fetch Join이 걸린 Entity 모두 영속화하기 때문에 FetchType이 Lazy인 Entity를 참조하더라도  
  이미 영속성 컨텍스트에 들어있기 때문에 따로 쿼리가 실행되지 않은 채로 N+1문제가 해결됨

```java
    @Override
    @Query("SELECT distinct b FROM Board b JOIN FETCH b.replieList")
    List<Board> findAll();
```

---------- BOARD 내부 REPLY 내용 조회 완료 (N+1 문제 발생) ----------
```

데이터를 한번에 가져와 영속화 시켜 N+1 문제가 발생되지 않습니다.


### @EntityGraph 사용

* 단순하게 fetch 조인을 어노테이션으로 사용할 수 있도록 만들어준 기능이다.

```java
    @Override
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "replieList")
    List<Board> findAll();
```

결과 및 발생 쿼리는 fetch join과 동일합니다.

### BatchSize 

* IN 쿼리를 통해 지정한 사이즈만큼 한번에 가져오는 것

```java
@BatchSize(size = 100)
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "board", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Reply> replieList = new ArrayList<>();
```

위와 같이 Entity에 직접 설정 또는 yml 파일에 속성 지정 가능  
`spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size`

위와같이 in 절을 톻애 데이터를 가져와 N +1 문제가 발생하지 않는것을 확인할 수 있습니다.

<br><br>

## 마치며
사실 위 `fetch join`, `@EntityGraph`는 `@xxxToOne` 관계에서만 적용하는게 현실적입니다.   
다시 한번 fetch join 쿼리를 확인해 보시면 제가 distinct 를 해준것을 볼 수 있습니다.  
`@xxxToMany` 관계에서 `fetch join` 및 `EntityGraph`를 적용하면 `페이징 처리 불가능 ` 및 `데이터 부정합 현상` 이 발생됩니다.

참고로 `BatchSize는` 어느 관계에서든 적용가능합니다. 

* `@xxxToOne` : `fetch join` or `@EntityGraph` or `batch size` 적용
* `@xxxToMany` : `batch size` 적용
